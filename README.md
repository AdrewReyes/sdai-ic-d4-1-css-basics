**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

### Prepare Your Workspace

1. [ ] First, stop any other Codespaces you have running.

### Create and Link a CSS File

2. [ ] Create a new CSS file named `styles.css` and link it to your HTML file by adding the following within the `<head>` element:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```

    Now, your `<head>` element should look like this:

    ```html
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My Simple Web Page</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```

### Change Paragraph Text Color

3. [ ] Change the color of all paragraph text to blue by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    p {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```

### Set Background Color

4. [ ] Set a background color for the entire page by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    body {
        background-color: lightgray;
    }
    ```

### Adjust Heading Font Size

5. [ ] Increase the font size of the most important heading (h1) to make it more prominent by adding the following CSS rule:

    ```css
    h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
    }
    ```

### View Changes and Troubleshoot

6. [ ] View the changes made to the webpage and troubleshoot any mistakes. Use GitHub Copilot for suggestions and corrections if needed.
